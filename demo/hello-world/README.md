# svelte-retag: Hello World

This is an **MVP** demo that shows `svelte-retag` in action in its simplest form in local development with a
`HelloWorld.svelte` component implemented as a `<hello-world>` custom element.

To try it out yourself, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed and then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patricknelson/svelte-retag.git
cd svelte-retag/demo/hello-world
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view the demo.
