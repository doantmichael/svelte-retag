# svelte-retag: Demo Site

https://svelte-retag.vercel.app/

Composed purely of Svelte custom elements in the light DOM, this site demonstrates:

* Slots (default and named slots)
* Nesting within slots
* The speed differences between deferred ESM vs. IIFE (on large pages), particularly with regard to CLS (Content Layout Shift)
* Vite HMR updates (if launched locally)
