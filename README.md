# svelte-retag

![Unit Tests](https://github.com/patricknelson/svelte-retag/actions/workflows/unit-tests.yml/badge.svg)

A web component wrapper for Svelte 3 and 4. Embeds your Svelte app or components inside custom elements using the light
DOM _or_ shadow DOM. Automatically forwards all slots and attributes to your Svelte app.

**Demo:** https://svelte-retag.vercel.app/

## Core Features

* üåü **Light DOM:** Allows you to render your Svelte components as custom elements in the light DOM as usual.
* üé∞ **Slots & Nesting:** Supports default and named slots in the _light DOM_ (with nesting).
* üß≠ **Context:** Use `setContext()` and `getContext()` and just compose your components as custom elements as you
	normally would ([see live tab demo](https://svelte-retag.vercel.app/)). Supports nesting.
* ‚ö° **Vite HMR:** Unlike Svelte, these custom elements are also compatible with Vite's HMR. It avoids the
	infamous `Failed to execute 'define' on 'CustomElementRegistry'` errors.
* üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **IIFE/UMD:** Supports building to `iife` and `umd` for eager rendering to the light DOM, as soon as the
	parser encounters the custom element. Reduces CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift), making it interactive more quickly
	_without_ waiting for `defer`'d scripts (such as modules).
* ‚öô **Composability:** `svelte-retag` gives you the flexibility to use your component as you normally would within
  Svelte _and_ as a custom element outside of Svelte (supporting both `<ExampleComponent />` and `<example-component>`).
  For details on how to use with PHP, Python, Ruby, etc., see [Backend Integration](#backend-integration) below.
* üíº **Portability:** Enables the freedom to utilize your Svelte components anywhere custom elements are supported,
	regardless of the stack (great for upgrading legacy applications).

## Why?

Svelte already allows you to compile your components to custom elements. However, it's missing features that we want to
add support for:

* Svelte 3: You have to use shadow DOM (no light DOM compatibility at all)
* Svelte 4: You cannot use slots in the light DOM (https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8963), which also means no
  nesting of your web components
* No context support (https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8987)
* Vite HMR doesn't work with custom elements (https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/8681 and https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-hmr/issues/26)

## How do I use it?

### Installation & Quick Start

```bash
npm install svelte-retag
```

Check out the [Hello World demo](https://github.com/patricknelson/svelte-retag/tree/main/demo/hello-world) to see it
in action yourself and for instructions on how to get started from scratch.

### <a id="backend-integration" />Backend Integration

If you're running a non-JavaScript backend such as PHP, Python, Ruby, etc. and would still like to use Vite (but cannot
rely solely on Vite for local development), see [Vite's Backend Integration documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/backend-integration.html).
This will guide you on how to run both your specific backend _and_ Vite's development server simultaneously.

#### Svelte vs. SvelteKit

Note that if you already have an existing backend, it is recommended that you just install `svelte` and not
`@sveltejs/kit` since the extra metaframework features of SvelteKit (such as routing) may not be necessary. SvelteKit is
now installed by default in the official documentation, so the extra complexity may be confusing when you are already
running a backend and just using `svelte-retag` to add web components into an existing site.

### Demo Code

Add the following to your main entrypoint. If you are using Vite, this would likely be `src/main.js`.

```javascript
import svelteRetag from 'svelte-retag';
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld.svelte';

svelteRetag({
	component: HelloWorld,
	tagname: 'hello-world',

	// Optional:
	attributes: ['greetperson'], // Changes to these attributes will be reactively forwarded to your component
	shadow: false, // Use the light DOM
	href: '/your/stylesheet.css', // Only necessary if shadow is true

	// Experimental:
	hydratable: false,
});
```

And in the `HelloWorld.svelte` Svelte component:

```svelte
<script>
	export let greetPerson = 'World';
</script>

<h1>Hello {greetPerson}!</h1>
```

Now anywhere you use the `<hello-world>` tag, you'll get a Svelte component. Note that you must set your tag
name
to [anything containing a dash](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements).

To align with Svelte 4, **attributes** are automatically converted to lowercase (following
the [Lit-style naming convention](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/#observed-attributes)). So, `greetPerson`
on your component would be automatically made available as `greetperson` on your custom element.

```html
<hello-world greetperson="Cris"></hello-world>
```

### Options

| Option       |   Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------|:------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `component`  | _(required)_ | The constructor for your Svelte component (from `import`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `tagname`    | _(required)_ | The custom element tag name to use ([must contain a dash](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `attributes` |     `[]`     | Optional. List of attributes to reactively forward to your component (does not reflect changes inside the component). <br> **Important:** Attributes must be the lowercase version of your Svelte component props ([similar to Lit](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/#observed-attributes)).                                                                                                               |
| `shadow`     |   `false`    | Optional. Indicates if this component should use shadow DOM.<br/> **Note:** Only basic support for shadow DOM is currently provided. See https://github.com/patricknelson/svelte-retag/issues/6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `href`       |     `''`     | Optional. URL to your stylesheet. Allows you to ensure your styles are included in the shadow DOM. This option is only useful when `shadow` is set to `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `hydratable` |   `false`    | Optional. If enabled, allows for SSR/SSG of custom elements managed by `svelte-retag` by including extra markup so that they can be initialized (or "hydrated") client-side from pre-rendered HTML. Enable this during SSR/SSG to allow for proper initialization. See [hydration demo here](https://svelte-retag.vercel.app/hydratable.html). <br><br>Note: Experimental. Compatible with light DOM rendering only. |

**Note:** For portability, `svelte-retag`'s API is fully backward compatible
with [`svelte-tag@^1.0.0`](https://github.com/crisward/svelte-tag).
