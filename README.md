# svelte-retag

![Node.js Package](https://github.com/patricknelson/svelte-retag/workflows/Node.js%20Package/badge.svg)

A web component wrapper for Svelte. Embeds your Svelte app or components inside custom elements using the light DOM _or_
shadow DOM. Automatically forwards all slots and attributes to your Svelte app.

## Core features

* **Light DOM:** Allows you to render your Svelte 3 components as custom elements in the light DOM as usual (without
	requiring use of the shadow DOM). Doing so allows you to take full advantage of global styles while still maintaining
	encapsulation of your component specific styles, utilizing web fonts and so on.
* **Vite HMR:** Unlike Svelte 3, these custom elements are also compatible with Vite's HMR. It avoids the infamous
	error `Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'define' on 'CustomElementRegistry': the name "example-component" has already been used with this registry`
* **Flexibility:** Allows you to define only the necessary components that need to be custom element tags. Use your
	component normally within Svelte (e.g. `<ExampleComponent />`) and as a custom element outside of Svelte (
	e.g. `<example-component></example-component>`).
* **Portability:** Freedom to utilize your Svelte components anywhere custom elements are supported (including in legacy
	applications, regardless of the stack).

## Why?

Svelte 3 already allows you to compile your components to custom elements. However, it has a couple of flaws:

* All of your nested components have to be implemented as custom elements, since the render flag applies to everything.
* You have to use shadow DOM.
* You have to deal with lots of bugs.
* You loose many features Svelte has for inter-component communication.

## How do I use it?

```bash
npm install svelte-retag
```

```javascript
import svelteRetag from 'svelte-retag'
import HelloWorld from 'hello-world.svelte'

svelteRetag({
	component: HelloWorld,
	tagname: 'hello-world',

	// Optional:
	attributes: ['greeting', 'name'],
	shadow: false,
	href: '/your/stylesheet.css', // Only necessary if shadow is true
})
```

Now anywhere you use the `<hello-world>` custom element tag, you'll get a Svelte app. Note that you must set your tag
name
to [anything containing a dash](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements).

```html
<hello-world name="Cris"></hello-world>
```

| Option     | Default      | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| component  | _(required)_ | The constructor for your Svelte component (from `import`)                                                                                         |
| tagname    | _(required)_ | The custom element tag name to use ([must contain a dash](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements)) |
| attributes | `[]`         | array -  List of attributes to reactively forward to your component (does not reflect changes inside the component)                               |
| shadow     | `false`      | boolean - Should this component use shadow dom                                                                                                    |
| href       | `''`         | link to your stylesheet - Allows you to ensure your styles are included in the shadow DOM (thus only required when `shadow` is set to `true`).    |

**Note:** For portability, the API for this `svelte-retag` package is backward compatible
with [`svelte-tag@^1.0.0`](https://github.com/crisward/svelte-tag).

## To Do

On the immediate horizon:

- [x] Migrate to Vitest for unit testing
- [x] Update logo
- [ ] ‚è≥ Fix nested slot support (WIP @ https://github.com/patricknelson/svelte-retag/pull/5)
- [ ] Support Lit-style lowercase props (see https://github.com/crisward/svelte-tag/issues/16)
- [ ] Better support for slots during early execution of IIFE compiled packages (i.e. use `MutationObserver` to watch
	for light DOM slots during initial parsing)
- [ ] Support context (see https://github.com/crisward/svelte-tag/issues/8)
